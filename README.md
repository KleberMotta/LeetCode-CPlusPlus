# [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/)

_So, why I've chosen LeetCode.com?_

> ["For coding interview preparation, LeetCode is one of the best online resource providing a rich library of more than 300 real coding interview questions for you to practice from using one of the 7 supported languages - C, C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby."](https://www.quora.com/How-effective-is-Leetcode-for-preparing-for-technical-interviews)

## The goal of this repo is?

 - #### The Polite and professional answer: 
   Keep track of my progress in the leetCode platform, hone my coding skills, and better prepare myself for job interviews that require a higher level of knowledge in Algorithms and data-structures.

 - #### The Honest answer: 
   I love problem-solving and coding :nerd_face:.

## Why C++?

C++ was the first programming language that I had contact with, back in 2014. The low-level programming concepts inside C++ are the main reason I keep coming back to it when I want to train my problem-solving skills. Despite my close and warm relationship with C++, currently, I'm focusing my professional tech knowledge in a specific JavaScript stack: NodeJS, ReactJS and React Native.
